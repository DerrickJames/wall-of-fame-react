# Wall Of Fame - React Client

This is the client-side implementation of the Wall Of Fame project using React. It is meant to be a playground to test out different ideas and approaches

tutorials and experiences on large scale system architectures,
design patterns, best practices and generally the way I think about elegant
code.
